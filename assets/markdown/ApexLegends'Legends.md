# Apex Legends' New Legends
*author : Dexerto.com* 
<br>
**There are now a total of 20 Legends to play in Apex – 12 more than the game released with. But Respawn isn’t stopping there, and there are plans for many more Legends to come with each new season. These are all the leaked Legends we know about so far.**


Many of the current Legends in the game appeared in leaks before they were official, and could very well be true for upcoming ones, too.

However, it’s also worth noting that with any leaks, things will change dramatically in development, and many characters are scrapped entirely, as you can see from the scrapped characters section below.

We’ve compiled a list of all the potentially upcoming Legends that have been leaked so far, along with their abilities. However, bear in mind that nothing has been confirmed yet, so take everything with a grain of salt.

## Leaked Legends in development

Based on the most recent Apex Legends leak, the following Legends are in development for future release. Again, there are no guarantees that these Legends ever make it into the game, or could be significantly reworked.
